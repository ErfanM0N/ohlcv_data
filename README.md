# AI Trading Bot - A Django-based Automated Trading System

This is a complete and fully functional Django application that serves as an automated trading bot for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. It's designed to handle the entire trading workflow, from market data collection to position execution and tracking.

## âœ¨ Key Features

  * **Automated Data Collection:** The bot automatically fetches **OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)** candle data from the Binance API and stores it in a database.
  * **Comprehensive API:** A robust RESTful API allows you to access market data and manage your trading activities programmatically.
  * **Automated Position Management:** The system can execute new trading positions, including pre-defined **Take Profit (TP)** and **Stop Loss (SL)** levels provided via the API.
  * **Real-time Tracking:** It actively monitors live positions, updating their status and outputting the results as they occur.
